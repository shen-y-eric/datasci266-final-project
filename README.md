## Report Title
Harnessing AI for Primary Care: Creating a Medical Summarizer with Fine-Tuned LLMs for Efficient Patient Outcomes

## Abstract
Clinicians dedicate a significant amount of time detailing discharge notes of various patients, yet oftentimes these notes encompass lengthy and complex characteristics making it difficult for others to extract valuable information, especially at larger health institutions with thousands of patients. The capability of generating concise and accurate summaries of clinical records is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare providers and ensuring comprehensive patient care. In this study, we dive into the adaptation methods of existing fine-tuned LLM architectures and investigate the efficacy of various state-of-the-art text summarization models on the MIMIC IV dataset, which is a de-identified electronic health records database of over 40,000 intensive care unit patients collected at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019; with a focus on discharge summaries and diagnoses. We present our fine-tuned text summarization model that has been built upon Googleâ€™s T5 model which outperformed our previous model iterations by achieving higher ROUGE scores and more accurate summarization quality. Our study highlights the potential of fine-tuned models in generating high-quality medical summaries, thereby aiding healthcare providers in quick and efficient patient data review.
