CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___: FINDINGS: CT ABDOMEN: There has been interval development of new small left and moderate right pleural effusions measuring ___ Hounsfield units. Compressive atelectasis is present. A few subcentimeter perivascular lung nodules are seen in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe, for example series 2, image 3, where the largest nodule measures 6 mm. These appear new or increased in size as compared to ___. The heart is normal in size. Trace coronary arterial calcification is seen along the right coronary artery. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared to ___, there is increased extent of severe intrahepatic biliary dilatation, with new dilated peripheral ducts or small bilomas the right hepatic lobe. Left and right hepatic ductal stents are redemonstrated. A CBD stent extends to the ampulla. An ill-defined hypoattenuating mass is redemonstrated in the region of biliary confluence, which does not demonstrate definite delayed enhancement on 10 minute delayed images. The gallbladder is surgically absent. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. Proximal pancreatic duct is mildly prominent, unchanged. Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The stomach is fluid filled. Small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber. There is no bowel wall thickening. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The left portal vein is thrombosed, with thrombus extending into segmental left portal system (2, 21), increased in extent since last exam. The right and main portal veins appear patent. Hepatic veins are patent. Great vessels are otherwise patent. A moderate-sized ascites is new. Again seen is a 4.6 x 3.2 cm anterior abdominal subcutaneous fluid-filled lesion, compatible with known extraperitoneal metastasis. More inferolaterally, a second soft tissue density centered in the anterior abdominal musculature adjacent to multiple clips is ill-defined and difficult to measure but similar as compared to ___, compatible with a second metastasis. These are overall stable as compared to prior study. Within the right inguinal region is a new 2.3 x 1.3 cm enhancing soft tissue deposit, concerning for new site of metastasis. A 2.6 x 2.3 x 2.4 cm centrally hypodense left inguinal lesion with peripheral enhancement is concerning for additional site of metastasis. CT PELVIS: The ascitic fluid extends to the pelvis. The bladder is collapsed. The uterus is small, but has multiple 1-2 cm intramural and subserosal enhancing masses, most likely representing fibroids. No pelvic side wall lymphadenopathy. BONE WINDOW: No focal concerning lesion. IMPRESSION: Overall worsening metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. 1. New small left and moderate right pleural effusions. New moderate abdominal ascites. 2. Increased number and size of multiple pulmonary nodules involving the right middle lobe and left lower lobe, largest 6 mm, concerning for metastatic involvement. 3. Stable ill-defined hypoattenuating lesion at the biliary confluence. 4. Status post left and right hepatic duct and common duct stenting, with interval increased degree of intrahepatic biliary dilatation as well as new loculated hypodensities in the peripheral right hepatic lobe, suggestive of biloma formation. No drainable collection. 5. Metastatic deposits involving anterior abdominal wall and bilateral inguinal regions. 6. Uterine fibroids. 7. Progressive left portal vein thrombosis extending into segmental left portal system. Portable CXR ___: The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is new right lower lobe opacity that might represent developing infection. There is also new faint opacity in the right upper lung, that might represent infectious focus as well and should be closely followed. Biliary stents are projecting over the right upper quadrant. Bilateral pleural effusion is better appreciated on the CT abdomen. ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. ST-T wave changes most consistent with underlying left ventricular hypertrophy, although ischemia or infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is no significant change. ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy, although is non-diagnostic. Modest low amplitude inferolateral T wave changes are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of ___ the rate is slower and T wave changes appear decreased. MRI L-Spine ___: FINDINGS: Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is partially visualized, with susceptibility artifact from biliary stent. These are better evaluated on the recent CT abdomen and pelvis. Ascites is also again demonstrated. Alignment is anatomic. There are no focal suspicious osseous lesions to suggest osseous metastases. Moderate disc desiccation is seen in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. The conus medullaris terminates at the level of the L1-L2 intervertebral disc with normal contour and signal. Mild facet degeneration is noted at L4-5, L5-S1, and L3-L4 without significant spinal canal or foraminal narrowing. There is no evidence of nerve root impingement. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of spinal metastases or nerve root impingement. Subtle metastases may not be seen without contrast. 2. Exstensive intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and ascites partially visualized. ERCP ___: IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful attempt to reach the ampulla for ERCP. Please refer to the endoscopist's note in OMR for further details of the procedure, during which malignant-appearing stricture in the duodenum prevented passage of the duodenoscope. ERCP ___: FINDINGS: Scout images demonstrate surgical clips in the right upper quadrant and two metal and one plastic biliary stents. The common bile duct was cannulated and opacified with contrast. The plastic biliary stent was removed. A stricture is noted at the distal right hepatic duct just proximal to superior end of the biliary stent. The stricture in the right hepatic duct was dilated and a metal stent was placed across the stricture. Contrast injected into the left hepatic duct showed minimal opacification of the left biliary system. In addition, a duodenal metal stent was also placed. For further details, please refer to the full ERCP report in the ___ medical record. CT abdomen/pelvis ___: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Moderate bilateral effusions, greater on the right than left, have increased somewhat. Associated parenchymal densities are most likely associated with atelectasis. These are similar to the recent prior exam. Coronary artery calcifications are widespread. A new metallic stent through the second portion of the duodenum has been placed since the prior examination. Two metallic stents remain in situ within the biliary ducts. Enteric contrast passes across the stent without evidence for extravasation of contrast or free air to indicate perforation. In the anterior right lobe, there are multiple air-fluid levels, the largest loculation probably measuring about 21 mm in diameter. These appear in continuity with the biliary ductal system and could be seen as increasing bilomas. Pneumobilia is more widespread and probably associated with stents as an anticipated appearance. The pancreatic duct is mildly dilated as before. The liver is otherwise not well delineated but ill-defined soft tissue in the hepatic hilum reflects a known Klatskin tumor. Biliary dilatation is mild-to-moderate but similar to somewhat decreased since the prior examination. There is widespread peritoneal carcinomatosis, including areas of thickened small bowel, although without obstruction. A segment of the proximal transverse colon, though not obstructed, is again narrowed and in keeping with malignant involvement along its surface. A subcutaneous nodule along the upper anterior subcutaneous tissues to the right of midline is similar in size. Similarly, a metastatic nodule in the left inguinal canal is unchanged. Extensive peritoneal nodularity in the pelvis nodularity is similar. A moderate to large quantity of ascites is present has considerably increased. BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post interval placement of duodenal stent which appears patent, without evidence for bowel perforation. 2. Increasing multilocular fluid collections in the periphery of the right lobe, in continuity with the biliary ducts including air-fluid levels, somewhat increased. Clinical correlation is recommended. 3. Similar to somewhat decreased intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation associated with obstruction by a Klatskin tumor in the liver hilum; the tumor is not well delineated on this examination. 4. Similar appearance of widespread peritoneal carcinomatosis, without evidence for bowel obstruction, the only change being a new moderate-to large quantity of ascites. 5. Known portal thrombus not assessed. Abdominal US ___: FINDINGS: Limited ultrasound of the abdominal quadrants was performed. Ascites is noted throughout the abdomen. The patient was initially transferred to the department for an ultrasound-guided paracentesis. However, during the initial pre-procedure scanning, the patient was extremely disoriented and expressed a desire not to continue with the examination. Further imaging of the abdomen was unable to be performed. At this point, the patient was transported back to her inpatient floor. IMPRESSION: Limited ultrasound demonstrating abdominal ascites. The requested paracentesis was unable to be performed due to the patient's condition at this time. CT Head w/o contrast ___: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality or significant change from prior. CT abdomen/pelvis ___: CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Moderate simple fluid-attenuation bilateral effusions with associated compressive atelectasis are similar to prior. Ill-defined nodular parenchymal densities are also similar to prior but poorly evaluated in the setting of effusions. Coronary artery calcifications are present. Evaluation of the abdominal organs is limited on noncontrast enhanced CT. Two metallic stents within the right and left hepatic ducts are similar in position. The metallic stent extending through the second portion of the duodenum is also similar to prior. The gallbladder is surgically absent. In the anterior right lobe of the liver, small air-fluid levels are again noted which have diminished in size compared to the prior study. These appear to be in continuity with the biliary system and could represent bilomas. The largest pocket measures approximately 2.7 x 2.7 cm compared to 3.0 x 2.5 cm previously. No new collection is identified on this limited non-contrast-enhanced CT. Ill-defined soft tissue density in the hepatic hilum is similar to prior, compatible with a Klatskin tumor. There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation as before. There is large amount of ascites, which has increased compared to the prior study. In addition, there is anasarca. Known peritoneal implants are not well evaluated on the current exam. There is residual contrast material within the large bowel. The previously noted collapsed segment of hepatic flexure/proximal transverse colon abutting the duodenum is less well evaluated on the current CT. Soft tissue density in the upper abdominal wall to the right of the midline measures approximately 4.6 x2.7 cm compared to 4.8 x 3.0 cm and is concerning for metastasis. The small bowel is not well evaluated due to the large volume of ascites and lack of oral contrast. The kidneys are symmetric in size without evidence of stones or hydronephrosis. BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified. IMPRESSION: 1. Resolving post-ERCP pneumobilia with persistent low-attenuation in the anterior right hepatic lobe with an air-fluid level similar to prior, which could represent a biloma or abscess. No new collection. 2. Little overall change in known metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and associated large ascites, intrahepatic biliary dilation and peritoneal carcinomatosis. 3. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 4. Known left portal vein thrombosis is not well evaluated on the current study. Brief Hospital Course: ___ woman with cholangiocarcinoma s/p cycle 2 of gemcitabine/cisplatin on ___, with h/o recurrent biliary obstruction s/p ERCP with stents and repeat ERCP and replaced stent ___, who presented with acute on chronic abdominal pain. . # Bacteremia: Initially pt was placed on IV cipro/flagyl following ERCP on ___. On ___, lab reported that blood culture from ___ was growing GNRs. Pt was switched to IV cefepime. ___ guided paracentesis of ascitic fluid was attempted for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes when bacteremia was discovered. However, pt had altered mental status and was too agitated to complete the procedure. She was treated empirically for SBP/bacteremia with cefepime and IV albumin. Family meeting was held to discuss pt's poor prognosis. Family decided to make her DNI/DNR. On morning of ___, pt's blood pressure fell to systolic ___. She was not responsive to IV fluids. Family was contacted. She passed before their arrival. Blood cultures ultimately grew haemophilus parainfluenzae and later enterococcus faecium sensitive to daptomyclin/linezolid and resistant to ampicillin/penicillin/vancomycin. . #. Abdominal pain: Pt initially presented with acute on chronic abdominal pain, largely in the RUQ. She also had elevated bilirubin, peaking at 6. CT abdomen on admission showed progression of her metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with pleural effusions, abdominal ascites, increasing pulmonary nodules, intrahepatic biliary dilatation and loculated hypodensities in liver, and metastatic deposits involving abdominal wall and bilateral inguinal regions. She was taken to ERCP on ___. She was found to have a duodenal stricture that could not be intervened upon. Her plavix was held in preparation for a repeat ERCP on ___. A stent was placed in the right hepatic duct and also in the duodenum. Bilirubin and LFTs began to downtrend following the procedure. She was placed on IV cipro/flagyl (see above). She could not tolerate po due to pain and was placed on TPN with IV fluids prn. For her abdominal pain, she was placed on a number of narcotic regimens. Palliative care was consulted for symptom control. She was initially placed on a dilaudid pca with fentanyl patch but this was complicated by increasing somnolence and confusion. She was started on ritalin to decrease somnolence. Mental status worsened and she became increasingly agitated and having hallucinations. Ritalin was stopped and she was transitioned to oxycontin and oxycodone. After her ERCP, abdomen was thought to be more tense and pt was with increasing pain. Surgery was consulted for possible perforation. However, repeat CT abdomen showed no perforation. . # Altered mental status: Pt had worsening mental status throughout hospital course. Initially with the uptitration of pain medications she became increasingly somnolent and confused. Later, she became agitated, having hallucinations, refusing certain therapies, and not sleeping. There was no improvement with zyprexa or seroquel. The acute change in MS was likely due to bacteremia. CT head was performed that showed no acute intracranial process. She was started on lactulose given possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. . # Acute renal failure: On ___, Cr began to rise. Cr had been normal 0.8-1.0 throughout most of admission, then began to increase, peaking at 1.5, despite IV hydration. Hepatorenal syndrome was suspected given her bacteremia ___ to possible SBP. She was given IV albumin without improvement. . # Back pain: On admission pt complained of back pain and leg weakness. On exam, she had diminished rectal tone. MRI of L-spine was obtained for concern of cord compression but this was negative for spinal metastases or nerve root impingement. . # Anemia: Hct ranged from mid to high ___ throughout admission. She received a total of 2 units PRBCs throughout admission. . # Cholangiocarcinoma: CT abdomen on admission showed progression of her metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with pleural effusions, abdominal ascites, increasing pulmonary nodules, intrahepatic biliary dilatation and loculated hypodensities in liver, and metastatic deposits involving abdominal wall and bilateral inguinal regions. She was s/p cycle 2 of gemcitabine/cisplatin in ___. Palliative care was involved in symptom control, primarily pain control. Family meeting was held with the pt's primary oncologist. It was communicated to the family that pt's prognosis was poor and that it was likely that she would not regain her health enough to be able to tolerate another cycle of chemotherapy. Family stated their wishes that they wanted to keep the pt full code and wanted her to be able to receive further chemotherapy. Later, when pt became bacteremic with altered mental status, family changed code status to DNI/DNR. . # CAD: Pt was s/p MI in ___. Medical records from ___ ___ were obtained which reported that pt had BMS stent placed in ___. Plavix was held briefly for ERCP and restarted after the procedure.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___: FINDINGS: CT ABDOMEN: There has been interval development of new small left and moderate right pleural effusions measuring ___ Hounsfield units. Compressive atelectasis is present. A few subcentimeter perivascular lung nodules are seen in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe, for example series 2, image 3, where the largest nodule measures 6 mm. These appear new or increased in size as compared to ___. The heart is normal in size. Trace coronary arterial calcification is seen along the right coronary artery. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared to ___, there is increased extent of severe intrahepatic biliary dilatation, with new dilated peripheral ducts or small bilomas the right hepatic lobe. Left and right hepatic ductal stents are redemonstrated. A CBD stent extends to the ampulla. An ill-defined hypoattenuating mass is redemonstrated in the region of biliary confluence, which does not demonstrate definite delayed enhancement on 10 minute delayed images. The gallbladder is surgically absent. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. Proximal pancreatic duct is mildly prominent, unchanged. Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The stomach is fluid filled. Small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber. There is no bowel wall thickening. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The left portal vein is thrombosed, with thrombus extending into segmental left portal system (2, 21), increased in extent since last exam. The right and main portal veins appear patent. Hepatic veins are patent. Great vessels are otherwise patent. A moderate-sized ascites is new. Again seen is a 4.6 x 3.2 cm anterior abdominal subcutaneous fluid-filled lesion, compatible with known extraperitoneal metastasis. More inferolaterally, a second soft tissue density centered in the anterior abdominal musculature adjacent to multiple clips is ill-defined and difficult to measure but similar as compared to ___, compatible with a second metastasis. These are overall stable as compared to prior study. Within the right inguinal region is a new 2.3 x 1.3 cm enhancing soft tissue deposit, concerning for new site of metastasis. A 2.6 x 2.3 x 2.4 cm centrally hypodense left inguinal lesion with peripheral enhancement is concerning for additional site of metastasis. CT PELVIS: The ascitic fluid extends to the pelvis. The bladder is collapsed. The uterus is small, but has multiple 1-2 cm intramural and subserosal enhancing masses, most likely representing fibroids. No pelvic side wall lymphadenopathy. BONE WINDOW: No focal concerning lesion. IMPRESSION: Overall worsening metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. 1. New small left and moderate right pleural effusions. New moderate abdominal ascites. 2. Increased number and size of multiple pulmonary nodules involving the right middle lobe and left lower lobe, largest 6 mm, concerning for metastatic involvement. 3. Stable ill-defined hypoattenuating lesion at the biliary confluence. 4. Status post left and right hepatic duct and common duct stenting, with interval increased degree of intrahepatic biliary dilatation as well as new loculated hypodensities in the peripheral right hepatic lobe, suggestive of biloma formation. No drainable collection. 5. Metastatic deposits involving anterior abdominal wall and bilateral inguinal regions. 6. Uterine fibroids. 7. Progressive left portal vein thrombosis extending into segmental left portal system. Portable CXR ___: The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is new right lower lobe opacity that might represent developing infection. There is also new faint opacity in the right upper lung, that might represent infectious focus as well and should be closely followed. Biliary stents are projecting over the right upper quadrant. Bilateral pleural effusion is better appreciated on the CT abdomen. ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. ST-T wave changes most consistent with underlying left ventricular hypertrophy, although ischemia or infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is no significant change. ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy, although is non-diagnostic. Modest low amplitude inferolateral T wave changes are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of ___ the rate is slower and T wave changes appear decreased. MRI L-Spine ___: FINDINGS: Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is partially visualized, with susceptibility artifact from biliary stent. These are better evaluated on the recent CT abdomen and pelvis. Ascites is also again demonstrated. Alignment is anatomic. There are no focal suspicious osseous lesions to suggest osseous metastases. Moderate disc desiccation is seen in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. The conus medullaris terminates at the level of the L1-L2 intervertebral disc with normal contour and signal. Mild facet degeneration is noted at L4-5, L5-S1, and L3-L4 without significant spinal canal or foraminal narrowing. There is no evidence of nerve root impingement. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of spinal metastases or nerve root impingement. Subtle metastases may not be seen without contrast. 2. Exstensive intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and ascites partially visualized. ERCP ___: IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful attempt to reach the ampulla for ERCP. Please refer to the endoscopist's note in OMR for further details of the procedure, during which malignant-appearing stricture in the duodenum prevented passage of the duodenoscope. ERCP ___: FINDINGS: Scout images demonstrate surgical clips in the right upper quadrant and two metal and one plastic biliary stents. The common bile duct was cannulated and opacified with contrast. The plastic biliary stent was removed. A stricture is noted at the distal right hepatic duct just proximal to superior end of the biliary stent. The stricture in the right hepatic duct was dilated and a metal stent was placed across the stricture. Contrast injected into the left hepatic duct showed minimal opacification of the left biliary system. In addition, a duodenal metal stent was also placed. For further details, please refer to the full ERCP report in the ___ medical record. CT abdomen/pelvis ___: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Moderate bilateral effusions, greater on the right than left, have increased somewhat. Associated parenchymal densities are most likely associated with atelectasis. These are similar to the recent prior exam. Coronary artery calcifications are widespread. A new metallic stent through the second portion of the duodenum has been placed since the prior examination. Two metallic stents remain in situ within the biliary ducts. Enteric contrast passes across the stent without evidence for extravasation of contrast or free air to indicate perforation. In the anterior right lobe, there are multiple air-fluid levels, the largest loculation probably measuring about 21 mm in diameter. These appear in continuity with the biliary ductal system and could be seen as increasing bilomas. Pneumobilia is more widespread and probably associated with stents as an anticipated appearance. The pancreatic duct is mildly dilated as before. The liver is otherwise not well delineated but ill-defined soft tissue in the hepatic hilum reflects a known Klatskin tumor. Biliary dilatation is mild-to-moderate but similar to somewhat decreased since the prior examination. There is widespread peritoneal carcinomatosis, including areas of thickened small bowel, although without obstruction. A segment of the proximal transverse colon, though not obstructed, is again narrowed and in keeping with malignant involvement along its surface. A subcutaneous nodule along the upper anterior subcutaneous tissues to the right of midline is similar in size. Similarly, a metastatic nodule in the left inguinal canal is unchanged. Extensive peritoneal nodularity in the pelvis nodularity is similar. A moderate to large quantity of ascites is present has considerably increased. BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. Status post interval placement of duodenal stent which appears patent, without evidence for bowel perforation. 2. Increasing multilocular fluid collections in the periphery of the right lobe, in continuity with the biliary ducts including air-fluid levels, somewhat increased. Clinical correlation is recommended. 3. Similar to somewhat decreased intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation associated with obstruction by a Klatskin tumor in the liver hilum; the tumor is not well delineated on this examination. 4. Similar appearance of widespread peritoneal carcinomatosis, without evidence for bowel obstruction, the only change being a new moderate-to large quantity of ascites. 5. Known portal thrombus not assessed. Abdominal US ___: FINDINGS: Limited ultrasound of the abdominal quadrants was performed. Ascites is noted throughout the abdomen. The patient was initially transferred to the department for an ultrasound-guided paracentesis. However, during the initial pre-procedure scanning, the patient was extremely disoriented and expressed a desire not to continue with the examination. Further imaging of the abdomen was unable to be performed. At this point, the patient was transported back to her inpatient floor. IMPRESSION: Limited ultrasound demonstrating abdominal ascites. The requested paracentesis was unable to be performed due to the patient's condition at this time. CT Head w/o contrast ___: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality or significant change from prior. CT abdomen/pelvis ___: CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Moderate simple fluid-attenuation bilateral effusions with associated compressive atelectasis are similar to prior. Ill-defined nodular parenchymal densities are also similar to prior but poorly evaluated in the setting of effusions. Coronary artery calcifications are present. Evaluation of the abdominal organs is limited on noncontrast enhanced CT. Two metallic stents within the right and left hepatic ducts are similar in position. The metallic stent extending through the second portion of the duodenum is also similar to prior. The gallbladder is surgically absent. In the anterior right lobe of the liver, small air-fluid levels are again noted which have diminished in size compared to the prior study. These appear to be in continuity with the biliary system and could represent bilomas. The largest pocket measures approximately 2.7 x 2.7 cm compared to 3.0 x 2.5 cm previously. No new collection is identified on this limited non-contrast-enhanced CT. Ill-defined soft tissue density in the hepatic hilum is similar to prior, compatible with a Klatskin tumor. There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation as before. There is large amount of ascites, which has increased compared to the prior study. In addition, there is anasarca. Known peritoneal implants are not well evaluated on the current exam. There is residual contrast material within the large bowel. The previously noted collapsed segment of hepatic flexure/proximal transverse colon abutting the duodenum is less well evaluated on the current CT. Soft tissue density in the upper abdominal wall to the right of the midline measures approximately 4.6 x2.7 cm compared to 4.8 x 3.0 cm and is concerning for metastasis. The small bowel is not well evaluated due to the large volume of ascites and lack of oral contrast. The kidneys are symmetric in size without evidence of stones or hydronephrosis. BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified. IMPRESSION: 1. Resolving post-ERCP pneumobilia with persistent low-attenuation in the anterior right hepatic lobe with an air-fluid level similar to prior, which could represent a biloma or abscess. No new collection. 2. Little overall change in known metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and associated large ascites, intrahepatic biliary dilation and peritoneal carcinomatosis. 3. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 4. Known left portal vein thrombosis is not well evaluated on the current study. Brief Hospital Course: ___ woman with cholangiocarcinoma s/p cycle 2 of gemcitabine/cisplatin on ___, with h/o recurrent biliary obstruction s/p ERCP with stents and repeat ERCP and replaced stent ___, who presented with acute on chronic abdominal pain. . # Bacteremia: Initially pt was placed on IV cipro/flagyl following ERCP on ___. On ___, lab reported that blood culture from ___ was growing GNRs. Pt was switched to IV cefepime. ___ guided paracentesis of ascitic fluid was attempted for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes when bacteremia was discovered. However, pt had altered mental status and was too agitated to complete the procedure. She was treated empirically for SBP/bacteremia with cefepime and IV albumin. Family meeting was held to discuss pt's poor prognosis. Family decided to make her DNI/DNR. On morning of ___, pt's blood pressure fell to systolic ___. She was not responsive to IV fluids. Family was contacted. She passed before their arrival. Blood cultures ultimately grew haemophilus parainfluenzae and later enterococcus faecium sensitive to daptomyclin/linezolid and resistant to ampicillin/penicillin/vancomycin. . #. Abdominal pain: Pt initially presented with acute on chronic abdominal pain, largely in the RUQ. She also had elevated bilirubin, peaking at 6. CT abdomen on admission showed progression of her metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with pleural effusions, abdominal ascites, increasing pulmonary nodules, intrahepatic biliary dilatation and loculated hypodensities in liver, and metastatic deposits involving abdominal wall and bilateral inguinal regions. She was taken to ERCP on ___. She was found to have a duodenal stricture that could not be intervened upon. Her plavix was held in preparation for a repeat ERCP on ___. A stent was placed in the right hepatic duct and also in the duodenum. Bilirubin and LFTs began to downtrend following the procedure. She was placed on IV cipro/flagyl (see above). She could not tolerate po due to pain and was placed on TPN with IV fluids prn. For her abdominal pain, she was placed on a number of narcotic regimens. Palliative care was consulted for symptom control. She was initially placed on a dilaudid pca with fentanyl patch but this was complicated by increasing somnolence and confusion. She was started on ritalin to decrease somnolence. Mental status worsened and she became increasingly agitated and having hallucinations. Ritalin was stopped and she was transitioned to oxycontin and oxycodone. After her ERCP, abdomen was thought to be more tense and pt was with increasing pain. Surgery was consulted for possible perforation. However, repeat CT abdomen showed no perforation. . # Altered mental status: Pt had worsening mental status throughout hospital course. Initially with the uptitration of pain medications she became increasingly somnolent and confused. Later, she became agitated, having hallucinations, refusing certain therapies, and not sleeping. There was no improvement with zyprexa or seroquel. The acute change in MS was likely due to bacteremia. CT head was performed that showed no acute intracranial process. She was started on lactulose given possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. . # Acute renal failure: On ___, Cr began to rise. Cr had been normal 0.8-1.0 throughout most of admission, then began to increase, peaking at 1.5, despite IV hydration. Hepatorenal syndrome was suspected given her bacteremia ___ to possible SBP. She was given IV albumin without improvement. . # Back pain: On admission pt complained of back pain and leg weakness. On exam, she had diminished rectal tone. MRI of L-spine was obtained for concern of cord compression but this was negative for spinal metastases or nerve root impingement. . # Anemia: Hct ranged from mid to high ___ throughout admission. She received a total of 2 units PRBCs throughout admission. . # Cholangiocarcinoma: CT abdomen on admission showed progression of her metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with pleural effusions, abdominal ascites, increasing pulmonary nodules, intrahepatic biliary dilatation and loculated hypodensities in liver, and metastatic deposits involving abdominal wall and bilateral inguinal regions. She was s/p cycle 2 of gemcitabine/cisplatin in ___. Palliative care was involved in symptom control, primarily pain control. Family meeting was held with the pt's primary oncologist. It was communicated to the family that pt's prognosis was poor and that it was likely that she would not regain her health enough to be able to tolerate another cycle of chemotherapy. Family stated their wishes that they wanted to keep the pt full code and wanted her to be able to receive further chemotherapy. Later, when pt became bacteremic with altered mental status, family changed code status to DNI/DNR. . # CAD: Pt was s/p MI in ___. Medical records from ___ ___ were obtained which reported that pt had BMS stent placed in ___. Plavix was held briefly for ERCP and restarted after the procedure.

Chief Complaint: back pain Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with BPD and chronic LBP who is transferred from ___ for management of worsening back pain and spine consultation for disc herniation. She has a long history of LBP secondary to a fall several years ago and her pain has been worsening for four weeks, with new lateral left thigh and leg numbness. She has also had two falls over the last few weeks in which she tripped over her left foot; no head trauma or LOC. She has been taking percocets and took ~30 tablets over the past three days. ROS is neg for bowel/bladder incontinence. She presented to ___ on ___ for evaluation of worsening pain and VS were 98.8 121/86 96%ra. She had an MRI which showed L4-5 disc extrusion and L5-S1 spinal nerve root compression and ?lumbar osteo, and she was given morphine 4mg iv x 2, dilaudid, ativan, and vancomycin per transfer documentation; doses are unknown for most of these medications. There was also mention of \"pain medication drug overdose\" in her transfer notes but this appears to be related to her history of multiple percocets; no objective data from her course at ___ support this diagnosis, e.g. stable VS, no naloxone given. In the ED, vital signs were initially: 98.8 94 121/86 12 96%. She was given dilaudid 1 mg iv x 1 for pain. Ortho spine was consulted and reccomended checking ESR/CRP to rule out osteo based on her MRI read; her films were reviewed. She was then admitted for pain management.

            "Reference Summary: You have undergone the following operation: Anterior and posterior lumbar fusion with posterior decompression. Immediately after the operation: -Activity: You should not lift anything greater than 10 lbs for 2 weeks. You will be more comfortable if you do not sit or stand more than ~45 minutes without getting up and walking around. -Rehabilitation/ Physical Therapy: o2-3 times a day you should go for a walk for ___ minutes as part of your recovery. You can walk as much as you can tolerate. oLimit any kind of lifting. -Diet: Eat a normal healthy diet. You may have some constipation after surgery. You have been given medication to help with this issue. -Brace: You may have been given a brace. This brace is to be worn when you are walking. You may take it off when sitting in a chair or while lying in bed. -Wound Care: Remove the dressing in 2 days. If the incision is draining cover it with a new sterile dressing. If it is dry then you can leave the incision open to the air. Once the incision is completely dry (usually ___ days after the operation) you may take a shower. Do not soak the incision in a bath or pool. If the incision starts draining at anytime after surgery, do not get the incision wet. Cover it with a sterile dressing. Call the office. -You should resume taking your normal home medications. -You have also been given Additional Medications to control your pain. Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic prescriptions, so please plan ahead. You can either have them mailed to your home or pick them up at the clinic located on ___. We are not allowed to call in or fax narcotic prescriptions (oxycontin, oxycodone, percocet) to your pharmacy. In addition, we are only allowed to write for pain medications for 90 days from the date of surgery. -Follow up: oPlease Call the office and make an appointment for 2 weeks after the day of your operation if this has not been done already. oAt the 2-week visit we will check your incision, take baseline X-rays and answer any questions. We may at that time start physical therapy. oWe will then see you at 6 weeks from the day of the operation and at that time release you to full activity.

Gallbladder sludge without evidence of gallbladder-wall thickening or edema. 2. Lobular echogenic lesion in the left hepatic lobe adjacent to a dilated intrahepatic bile duct measuring up to 1.9 cm, may represent biliary sludge or a focal lesion. MRI is recommended for further evaluation. CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 1. The gallbladder is distended, containing small calculi and sludge in the region of the neck with minimal pericholecystic fluid. Although the adjacent hepatic parenchyma is mild hyperemic, there is no soft tissue stranding sys surrounding the gallbladder. The ultrasound performed a day prior demonstrated no evidence of acute cholecystitis and constellation of these findings may therefore represent gallbladder wall edema secondary to a hepatic pathology rather than cholecystitis. There is associated cystic duct wall enhancement. 2. The liver has a lobulated contour and there is atrophy of the left lobe. There are multiple dilated left intrahepatic bile ducts that converge towards the hilum. Hyperdense filling defects within the dilated left intrahepatic bile ducts represent intraductal calculi. The left branch of the portal vein is diminutive. These findings likely reflect presence of an underlying stricture as no obstructing mass noted. Chronic left hepatic duct stricture causing upstream intrahepatic bile duct dilation, stasis, intraductal calculus formation and resultant atrophy of the left hepatic lobe noted. MRI of the liver with contrast is recommended to look for cholangitis and any visible underlying cause for left-sided intrahepatic bile duct dilation. 3. There is mild perinephric stranding on both sides with wedge-shaped hypodensities in the superior pole of both kidneys and in the lower pole of the left kidney respectively raising concern for mild pyelonephritis. Correlation with urinalysis is recommended to look for infection. MRCP (MR ABD ___ Study Date of ___ 1. Mild distention of the gallbladder. Mild gallbladder wall thickening. Layering sludge and stones in the gallbladder lumen. No pericholecystic fluid or reactive enhancement of the surrounding hepatic parenchyma to suggest acute cholecystitis. 2. Chronic atrophy of the left lobe of the ___ around dilated ducts which contain multiple stones. The ductal dilatation is related to a high-grade stricture, approximately 1.6 cm above the confluence of for the right and left hepatic duct. No obvious masslike enhancement is noted at the level of the stricture. This does not exclude a malignant etiology for this stricture. The intraductal stones are likely secondary to stasis. 3. In addition to the ductal changes described in the left lobe of the liver, there is surrounding patchy parenchymal enhancement suggestive of cholangitis. Similar changes are noted in the posterior right liver lobe, without associated ductal dilatation, again likely reflecting cholangiopathy. Furthermore, there is abnormal enhancement of the CBD and cystic duct wall, reflective of extrahepatic cholangitis. No filling defects within the CBD. 4. Two small incidental cystic lesions in the body of the pancreas, measuring up to 5 mm in diameter. There is no evidence of main duct involvement. Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with HTN, CAD s/p DESx1 to pLAD ___, h/o cholelithiasis who presented with abdominal pain, was found to have cholangitis and underwent ERCP with ___ placement.
